# Smart-Hand-Sanitizer-
A IOT Based Smart Sanitizer using IR Sensor and Servo Motor.


## Overview
This project focuses on creating an automatic hand sanitizer dispenser using IoT, Arduino, an IR sensor, and a servo motor. The system is designed to provide a contactless and efficient solution for hand sanitization.

## Problem Statement
In the wake of global health concerns, there is a need for touch-free solutions to promote hand hygiene. This project addresses the challenge of providing a convenient and automatic hand sanitization process.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to contribute to public health by creating a system that reduces the risk of germ transmission through shared surfaces. The integration of IoT and automation enhances user experience and encourages regular hand sanitization.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution involves the use of Arduino for control, an IR sensor for hand detection, and a servo motor for dispensing the sanitizer. IoT connectivity allows for remote monitoring and control.
